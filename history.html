<h2>How It All Began</h2>
<p>CMU Bhangra was initially started in 2005 by a group of friends who wanted to put on a proper dance at our school's South Asian show. From there they decided to officially form a team, <span class="highlight">CMU Chak De</span>, and asked the school and the South Asian organization, Mayur-SASA for money and resources. That small group soon grew as they impressed the school with their fun and passion and eventually became a small competitive team.
Since that time, CMU Bhangra has grown in size and name (just check out the alumni section!). We've become a completely independent organization within our school, and taken on the name 'CMU Bhangra' to represent that. As we compete nationwide at various competitions we hope to bring the same passion and fun that started the whole thing just a few years back.</p>
<br />
<h2>Continuing The Passion</h2>
<p>The appeal of bhangra and the success of the team led to an unprecedented number of people trying out for the team. To accomodate and foster the interest, a second team was formed in 2009, the <span class="highlight">Campus Team</span>, with the intent of grooming the next generation of CMU Bhangra competitive dancers. Their focus initially was on performing around Pittsburgh and raising awareness of the dance within our community, but this second team also competed on their own and were very successful, placing third at Ohio State's Buckeye Mela Srujan in 2010 and competing at Nasha in 2011, Nach Ke Dikha in 2012, and Srujan again in 2013.
Furthermore, for anyone in the Carnegie Mellon community interested in learning how to bhangra (or just looking for a great workout), CMU will be offering a Stuco title <span class="highlight">Bhangra 101</span> taught be several team members starting in Fall 2013. Send us an email or check out the <a href="services.html">Services</a> page if you're interested in getting involved and learning!</p>
